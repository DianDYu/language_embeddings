## Abstract
Cross-lingual language tasks typically requirea substantial amount of annotated data or par-allel  translation  data.We  explore  whetherlanguage representations that capture relation-ships  among  languages  can  be  learned  andsubsequently leveraged in cross-lingual taskswithout  the  use  of  parallel  data.   We  gener-ate dense embeddings for 29 languages usinga denoising autoencoder, and evaluate the em-beddings using the World Atlas of LanguageStructures (WALS) and two extrinsic tasks ina zero-shot setting:  cross-lingual dependencyparsing and cross-lingual natural language in-ference.
